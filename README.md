# ThreeJS OP-1

This is a parallel project to my other one where I attempt to model and render
an OP-1 by Teenage Engineering using pure WebGL. It's pretty hard so I've created
this meanwhile so that I can have something to hopefully progress on faster and
carry over ideas to the original repository.

It looks like ThreeJS doesn't really have many modeling tools by a quick look,
but I might find it does or in the case of this project I will be happier to use
CSG.js whereas in my pure WebGL demo I prefer to tesselate the parts by hand and
try to avoid it.

I started this project using this guide:
